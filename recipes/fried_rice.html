    <h1>Fried Rice with Shrimp and Peas</h1>

    <p>"This is a more subdued version of fried rice than the spicier Thai fried rice. It’s a great dish to make if you have cooked rice on hand and a great vehicle for whatever vegetables may be in your refrigerator. Feel free to add other cooked vegetables, meat or seafood." <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012702-chinese-fried-rice-with-shrimp-and-peas">Source</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger</li>
    <li>½ pound medium shrimp, peeled, deveined and cut in 3/4-inch pieces</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dry sherry</li>
    <li>5 to 6 cups cooked and cooled basmati or long-grain rice</li>
    <li>1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated</li>
    <li>½ cup cooked fresh or thawed frozen peas</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped cilantro</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>


    <li>Beat one of the eggs in a small bowl and salt lightly. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil over medium-high heat in a small nonstick frying pan, and add the beaten egg. Swirl in the pan until the egg forms an even coat, like a thin pancake. When the egg is cooked through, roll up and slide onto a plate. Cut in thin strips (you can use a scissors or a knife). Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat a wok or large, heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until a drop of water evaporates upon contact. Add the remaining oil and swirl around the pan, then add the shrimp and cook about one minute, stirring and tossing with a spatula or wok scoop until just about cooked through and pink. Add the garlic and ginger, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the sherry, and stir everything together. When the sizzling stops, pour in the remaining beaten egg. Stir-fry until scrambled, and add the rice. Cook the rice — scooping it up, then pressing it into the pan and scooping it up again — for about two minutes. Stir in white and lighter green parts of the scallions, the peas and the soy sauce. Stir together for about half a minute, and transfer to a warm serving platter. Sprinkle the egg strips, scallion greens and cilantro over the top. Serve hot.</li>
